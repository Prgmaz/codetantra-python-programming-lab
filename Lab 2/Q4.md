##### Solution
```
n = int(input("Enter the number of steps to be printed: "))

for i in range(1, n + 1):
    k = i + 1 if i % 2 != 0 else i
    for g in range(k, (n - k // 2 + 1) * 2 - 3):
        if g>= k:
            print(end=" ")
    for g in range(0, k):
        if ( n == i or (n == i + 1 and i % 2 != 0)) and k and g == 0:
            print(" * ", end="")
        else:
            print("  * ", end="")
    print("")
