## Question
Create a tuple with the user given inputs. Write a program using membership operators to check whether the given element is present in the tuple or not. Print the result as shown in the examples.

## Output
```
Enter tuple elements separated by ,(Comma): 10,20,30,40,50,60
Elements of tuple: ('10', '20', '30', '40', '50', '60')
Enter an element to check whether it exist in tuple or not: 50
True
```
```
Enter tuple elements separated by ,(Comma): Python,Perl,Php,Java,Swift
Elements of tuple: ('Python', 'Perl', 'Php', 'Java', 'Swift')
Enter an element to check whether it exist in tuple or not: R
False
```

## Hints
Tuple membership test is used to verify if an element exists in a Tuple or not.

Python provides two operators in and not in for this purpose.

The result of using these operators is a boolean value True or False.
```
x = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(2 in x)
True
print(8 not in x)
True
print(10 in x)
False
print(5 in x)
True
```

## Solution
```
items = input("Enter tuple elements separated by ,(Comma): ").split(",")
items = tuple(items)

print("Elements of tuple:", items)
e = input("Enter an element to check whether it exist in tuple or not: ")
print(e in items)
```
