## Question
Take string as input from the console using `input()` function. Write a program to find how many times each character is repeated in a given string. Print each character in the string in sorted order with number of times it is repeated as shown in the example.

## Output
```
Please enter sentence: Hello Python!
' '	1
'!'	1
'H'	1
'P'	1
'e'	1
'h'	1
'l'	2
'n'	1
'o'	2
't'	1
'y'	1
[' ', '!', 'H', 'P', 'e', 'h', 'l', 'n', 'o', 't', 'y']
```

## Solution
```
str = input("Please enter sentence: ")
str = sorted(str)

d = {}

for i in str:
        d[i] = d.get(i, 0) + 1

for k,v in d.items():
        print("'{}'\t{}".format(k,v))

print(list(d.keys()))
```
