## Question
Write a function frequency(l), which outputs the items with lowest frequency and items with highest frequency.

Consider an example: [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 4, 6, 6, 7, 8] should return ([3, 7, 8], [6], 1, 3) which means that 3, 7, 8 have appeared only once in the list which is the minimum number of times and 6 has appeared 3 times which is the maximum number of times.

[1, 2, 3, 4] should return ('Null', [1, 2, 3, 4], 0, 1) which means there is no minimum count.

## Output
```
Please enter integers separated by spaces: 1 2 3 1 2 5
([3, 5], [1, 2], 1, 2)
```

## Solution
```
def frequency (seq):
        # write your code here
        d = {}
        for i in seq:
                d[i] = d.get(i, 0) + 1

        min_num = min(d.values())
        max_num = max(d.values())
        min_list = [k for k,v in d.items() if v == min_num]
        max_list = [k for k,v in d.items() if v == max_num]
        return(sorted(min_list), sorted(max_list), min_num, max_num)

l1 = [int(x) for x in input("Please enter integers separated by spaces: ").split()]
print (frequency(l1))
```
