## Question
Write a program to find the sum of a recursive number list like L1 = [1, 10, 9, [3, 5, 7], [5, [6, 7], 97]], print the result as shown in the exmple.

We cannot use sum(L1) because it will produce the following error:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<interactive input>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'list'
```

We need to go through the list recursively as follows:
```
tot = 0
for element in nested_num_list:
	if type(element) == type([]):
		tot += r_sum(element)
	else:
		tot += element
```

## Output
```
150
```

## Solution
```
def r_sum(nested_num_list):
        total = 0
        for e in nested_num_list:
                if type(e) == type([]):
                        total += r_sum(e)
                else:
                        total += e
        return total

# write your code here
L1 = [1, 10, 9, [3, 5, 7], [5, [6, 7], 97]]
print(r_sum(L1))
```
