## Question
Write a program to find the `factorial` of a given number using recursion process. Print the result as shown in the examples.

In the below program it writes a **recurfact()** function. In the main program it takes the input and sends it to the **recurfact()** function.

The **recurfact()** function contains base and recursive criterion, where base condition executes only when the value equals **zero (0)**.

## Hints
```
First consider the mathematical solution of the factorial problem.

    The factorial of a number 3 can be calculated as 3! = 3 * 2 * 1
    The factorial of a number 4 can be calculated as 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
    The factorial of a number 5 can be calculated as 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
    In the similar way factorial of a number n can be calculated as  n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) *.... 3 * 2 * 1

The recursive formula for factorial is:

n! = n * (n - 1)! if n > 0 (Recursive criterion)
n! = 1 if n = 0 (Base criterion)
```

## Output
```
Enter a number: 7
The factorial of the given number is  5040
```

## Solution
```
#Program to illustrate recursion
def recurfact(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * recurfact(n-1)

# write your code here

n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if n < 0:
    print("The factorial does not exist for a negative number")
else:
    print("The factorial of the given number is ", recurfact(n))
```
