##### Question
Write a python program to print 'n' terms of Fibonacci series using iteration(Use Dynamic Programming).

##### Output
```
How·many·terms·to·print?:·5
Fibonacci·sequence:
0
1
1
2
3
```
```
How·many·terms·to·print?:·3
Fibonacci·sequence:
0
1
1
```

##### Solution
```
n = int(input("How many terms to print?: "))
num1 = 0
num2 = 1

print("Fibonacci sequence:")
print(num1)
print(num2)
for i in range(2, n):
        num1, num2 = num2, num1 + num2
        print(num2)
```
